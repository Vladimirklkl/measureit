{"name":"Measureit","tagline":"Software for Current Cost devices to store usage or creation watt data and display them with nice graphs","body":"Welcome to the measureit Project\r\n\r\nMeasureit allows you to have your own server to store your voltage and temperature data. It has a  easy to use web interface that is completely written in javascript and jquery to see your power consumption.\r\n\r\nCurrently it works with the hardware from Current Cost (currentcost.com) with the Classic, Envi and the EnviR\r\n\r\nYou are able to see the detailed consumption in real time or see your consumption from the last week or from a user defined time range and has a overview of the energy consumption and cost per sensor / sensor position / year / month /day usage. There are also different graphs to display a weekly or yearly overview in a comparison or you can see the data usage per weekday or per hour or.....\r\n\r\nMeasureit has clamp support. You can see the data from every clamp and the total usage from a sensor with multiple clamps.\r\n\r\nThe storage database is optimized to store millions of voltage data without using much storage. In 4 months a sensor writes about 1.000.000 data sets that use just about 25 MB of storage. Measureit delete old data automatically after a user defined period.\r\n\r\nThe hardware used with this project comes from currentcost that offers a base station with up to 9 sensors. Measureit supports the usage up to all 9 sensors and multiple clamps per Sensor.\r\n\r\nYou can send the consumption data and the produced data from your solar system to the [http://pvoutput.org PVOutput] Service too. Every clamp, sensor or IAM can send data to their service. So you are able to see your data from everywhere without running a server at your home. They are creating nice graphs too :)\r\n\r\nThere are options to create notifications per email or twitter if a user defined usage / generation is over / under a user defined value / time. \r\n\r\nMore informations about measureit you can find in the wiki from the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Multiple languages*\r\n\r\nMeasureit is able to speak your language. If your language is not in the list and you wish to help so feel free to translate this small text file. It is just about 10 minutes of work. Send your translated file and it will be included as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe file to translate you will find here:\r\nhttps://github.com/lalelunet/measureit/blob/master/measureit_public_html/lng/en_EN.txt\r\n\r\nCurrently available languages are:\r\n  * English\r\n  * German\r\n  * Italian\r\n  * French\r\n  * Dutch\r\n  * Catalan\r\n  * Spanish\r\n  * Brazilian Portuguese\r\n\r\nSend you translation to measureitsoft@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThere are some language settings that are missing because of the extension from measureit.
